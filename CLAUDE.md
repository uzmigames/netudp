# CLAUDE.md

This project is managed by [@hivehub/rulebook](https://github.com/hivellm/rulebook).
The authoritative rules come from the imports below. Claude Code loads all of them
automatically at session start (see [Anthropic memory docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#claude-md-imports)).

## Project identity & live state

## Core standards (team-shared, versioned)
@AGENTS.md

## Project-specific overrides (user-owned, survives `rulebook update`)

## Critical rules (highest precedence — apply on every turn)

1. **Read `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.override.md`** before making changes. These contain project-specific conventions that override generic guidance.
2. **Never revert or discard uncommitted work** — fix forward. Treat the working tree as sacred; investigate before destructive operations.
3. **Edit files sequentially**, not in parallel. When a task touches 3+ files, decompose into 1–2 file sub-tasks.
4. **Run `check`/type-check before `test`** — diagnostic-first. Cheap diagnostics catch issues that expensive test suites miss or take longer to surface.
5. **If a fix fails twice, escalate** — stop, research, or open a team. Do not retry the same approach a third time.
6. **Prefer MCP tools** (`mcp__rulebook__*` and project-specific MCP servers) over shell commands when the equivalent tool exists.
7. **Capture learnings**: at the end of significant work, save patterns and anti-patterns to `.rulebook/knowledge/` and insights to `.rulebook/learnings/`.
8. **Never archive a task** without docs updated, tests written, and tests passing — the task tail enforces this structurally.

## Persistent memory

This project uses the Rulebook MCP server for persistent memory across sessions.

- **Start of session**: `rulebook_memory_search` for relevant prior context.
- **During work**: `rulebook_memory_save` for decisions, bugs, discoveries, user preferences.
- **End of session**: `rulebook_session_end` to write a session summary.

Memory is auto-captured for tool interactions (task create/update/archive, skill enable/disable). Manual saves are required for everything else worth remembering.

## Knowledge base

Before implementing anything non-trivial:

- `rulebook_knowledge_list` — check existing patterns and anti-patterns.
- `rulebook_learn_list` — review past learnings.
- `rulebook_decision_list` — review architectural decisions.

After implementing, capture at least one entry per task:

- `rulebook_knowledge_add` for reusable patterns or anti-patterns to avoid.
- `rulebook_learn_capture` for implementation insights that don't belong in code comments.
- `rulebook_decision_create` for significant architectural choices.

## Task workflow

**MANDATORY: ALWAYS use the Rulebook MCP tools for task management.** Never create task directories or files manually — use `rulebook_task_create`, `rulebook_task_update`, `rulebook_task_archive`, `rulebook_task_list`, `rulebook_task_show`, `rulebook_task_validate`. These tools enforce naming conventions, mandatory tail items, phase structure, and metadata that manual file creation skips.

1. `rulebook_task_list` to see pending work.
2. `rulebook_task_create` to create new tasks — **never `mkdir` + `Write` manually**.
3. Pick the **first unchecked item from the lowest-numbered phase** — never reorder.
4. Read the task's `proposal.md` and `tasks.md` before touching code.
5. Implement step by step. Run lint + type-check after each significant change.
6. `rulebook_task_update` to change task status as you progress.
7. Mark items `[x]` in `tasks.md` as you finish them.
8. The mandatory tail (docs + tests + verify) is **not optional** — `rulebook_task_archive` will refuse to close the task otherwise.
